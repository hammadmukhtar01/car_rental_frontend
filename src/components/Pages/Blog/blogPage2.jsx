              What to expect in Dubai?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Dubai not only attracts visitors from around the globe but also
              has residents from various ethnicities. The official language of
              the UAE is Arabic. However, English is the second most used
              language used for businesses as well by everyone in Dubai. The
              currency of UAE is the Dirham, so if you are planning to travel
              here better get your cash converted.
              <br />
              <br />
              Dubai is the desert so it gets extremely hot in the summers
              spiking to 50 degrees. This is the reason residents and visitors
              go to beaches like Jumeirah and resorts to cope with extreme
              weather. Winters however are comfortable and it is always a good
              idea to spend an evening in parks.
              <br />
              <br />
              Dubai has some rules and cultural observations that need to be
              followed. Look for the dress code when going out in Dubai and
              watch out for the prohibited signs. For example, taking pictures
              of semi-government, military sites, and even some beaches are
              prohibited. Be respectful of their rules or you may be imposed a
              heavy fine.

              How to travel within Dubai?
            </h3>

            <p>
              When you have chosen Dubai for vacation, there are a lot of
              transport options. From the moment you land at the airport to
              riding around the city, travelling is very easy in Dubai. There
              are public transport options like the Dubai Tram and buses,
              individual taxis, bicycles, boats, and marines or you can rent a
              car of your choice.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, it would help if you were mindful of the rules while
              travelling too. Dubai's metro is the largest driverless train
              system in the world, and it allows you to travel around the city.
              However, it has its rules and there are separate cabins for women,
              men, and the gold class. All these cabins are reserved for
              different categories, so watch the signs. It is also forbidden to
              eat/drink in the metro.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are Dubai taxis and other companies that provide fleet
              services. All the cabs have a meter charge and if you are going
              through a tool road, you'd also get a Salik charge.
              <br />
              <br />
              Dubai has a lot of attractions on the water and near it. You can
              get water ferries and taxis that can take you to and fro 44 stops.
              Water taxi tickets are available online.
              <br />
              <br />
              Bikes can be rented that are available at the curbside station.
              You can travel throughout the city and return it once done. The
              same goes for the car rental service. You can rent a car in Dubai
              if you have an international driving permit, passport, and visitor
              visa. Milele car rental provides the best economy to luxury cars
              on rent. They provide Sedan, SUV, 7-seater as well as hatchback
              cars to fit the needs of every family size. With Milele car rental

              and book any car with ease.
              <br />
              <br />
              Each mode of transport offers a unique way to explore Dubai,
              whether you're looking for efficiency, budget-friendliness, or the
              experience of the journey itself.

                        The Dubai Creek is a natural saltwater creek that
                        extends 9 miles inwards, forming a natural port for
                        transport and trading purposes. This
                        watercourse/waterway in Dubai is reminiscent of the lost
                        Arabian world. Both sides of Dubai Creek are surrounded
                        by old-style markets, museums, and heritage buildings.
                        This historical part of Dubai offers insights into the
                        city's trading history and is home to vibrant souks such
                        as the Gold Souk and Spice Souk.
