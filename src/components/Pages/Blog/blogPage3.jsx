            <h3 className="blog3-navigation-app-heading">Apple Maps App</h3>
            <p>
              Now use your Apple Maps app to get places. You can use it on your
              iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch and in the car with CarPlay.

              right directions. You can also share a list of your favourite
              locations using this app. Besides offering real-time updates and
              routes to follow, Apple Maps can also share ETA with friends and

              expected. Apple Maps App is available in both Arabic and English.
            </p>

            <h3 className="blog3-navigation-app-heading">Google Maps</h3>

            <p>
              Perhaps the best-known and most-used app is Google Maps, which has
              adaptive tech, in case you get lost, it will point out a new route
              to your destination. Visual and spoken cues help guide your way.
              It also points out if you are on a busy road and allows you to
              share your live location with others. Google Maps is available in
              many languages, and has the bonus of offering aerial and satellite
              views of most locations.{" "}
            </p>

            <h3 className="blog3-navigation-app-heading">Waze </h3>

            <p>
              One of the most commonly used apps is Waze, which will lead you
              from road to road, zooming in on turns and calling out the
              direction you need to take. It's a community-driven navigation
              app. What that means is, thanks to the number of drivers using the
              app, real-time data is being collected, aggregated, and analysed
              by it, so when it gives you updates on a road, it's quite current.
              It'll tell you if you are headed to a congested area, the tolls
              you may be subject to on your route and even where you can stop
              for a quick fuel up. If you are speeding, the app will give you a
              warning, helping you cut down on those road fines. Waze is
              available in several languages besides English, but it's not yet
              available in Arabic. Get Waze on Google Play or Apple Store.{" "}
            </p>

              No internet? No problem. With RTA Smart Drive you can plan,
