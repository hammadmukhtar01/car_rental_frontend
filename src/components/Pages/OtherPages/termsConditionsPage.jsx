                specified (currently AED 1,500/-), or the actual cost of the

                waive the liability of the HIRER for the amount payable under
                this condition. However, if the Vehicle is used, operated, or
                driven in violation of the terms of this agreement, the HIRER
                will be liable for the full cost of any damage or loss, or any
                resulting loss to MILELE.
                <br />
                <br />
                The insurance coverage will be void if the HIRER, without
                authorization from MILELE, hands over the vehicle to any other
                person or causes damage through unauthorized use.
